# Titanic Survivor Supervised Learning Prediction Model

### This model predicts the survival of passengers based on the Titanic Kaggle dataset

#### I used Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression Classifier and compared their results

## Stages: 

#### Preprocessing data: fixing missing data and encoding string into numerical values, feature engineering
#### ML pipelines: for each classifier, we built a different pipleline
#### Train, Predict, Evaluate, and print classsification report for both models
#### Feature importance for Random Forest
#### cross validation for both models
#### Finetuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV for Random Forest model
#### train, predict, evaluate the finetuned model
